/**

 * @short_description: Functions for managing textures in Cogl's global
 *                     set of texture atlases
 *
 * A texture atlas is a texture that contains many smaller images that
 * an application is interested in. These are packed together as a way
 * of optimizing drawing with those images by avoiding the costs of
 * repeatedly telling the hardware to change what texture it should
 * sample from.  This can enable more geometry to be batched together
 * into few draw calls.
 *
 * Each #CoglContext has an shared, pool of texture atlases that are
 * are managed by Cogl.
 *
 * This api lets applications upload texture data into one of Cogl's
 * shared texture atlases using a high-level #CoglAtlasTexture which
 * represents a sub-region of one of these atlases.
 *
 * <note>A #CoglAtlasTexture is a high-level meta texture which has
 * some limitations to be aware of. Please see the documentation for
 * #CoglMetaTexture for more details.</note>
