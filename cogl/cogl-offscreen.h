/**
 * cogl_offscreen_new_with_texture:
 * @texture: A #CoglTexture pointer
 *
 * This creates an offscreen framebuffer object using the given
 * @texture as the primary color buffer. It doesn't just initialize
 * the contents of the offscreen buffer with the @texture; they are
 * tightly bound so that drawing to the offscreen buffer effectively
 * updates the contents of the given texture. You don't need to
 * destroy the offscreen buffer before you can use the @texture again.
 *
 * <note>This api only works with low-level #CoglTexture types such as
 * #CoglTexture2D, #CoglTexture3D and #CoglTextureRectangle, and not
 * with meta-texture types such as #CoglTexture2DSliced.</note>
 *
 * The storage for the framebuffer is actually allocated lazily
 * so this function will never return %NULL to indicate a runtime
 * error. This means it is still possible to configure the framebuffer
 * before it is really allocated.
 *
 * Simple applications without full error handling can simply rely on
 * Cogl to lazily allocate the storage of framebuffers but you should
 * be aware that if Cogl encounters an error (such as running out of
 * GPU memory) then your application will simply abort with an error
 * message. If you need to be able to catch such exceptions at runtime
 * then you can explicitly allocate your framebuffer when you have
 * finished configuring it by calling cogl_framebuffer_allocate() and
 * passing in a #CoglError argument to catch any exceptions.
 *
 * Return value: (transfer full): a newly instantiated #CoglOffscreen
 *   framebuffer.
